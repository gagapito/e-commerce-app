# Fashion Boyz

E-commerce shop for male streetwear and designer accessories

The concept behind this application was to incorporate my interest with a project. My personal interest in fashion/streetwear led me to come up with the idea of creating an e-commerce shop that sold all of the products I would like. Additionally, I wanted to familiarize myself with Javascript and different APIs that could be used to create this site.

## Project Infromation

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). The project was written with Javascript in Visual Studio.

Fashion Boyz has all the functionality of an e-commerce website:

- A home page that advertises the different product listings
- A cart that locally stores the items you place into it meaning that if you were to exit the site and return the cart items you had will remain in the cart
- Add/remove items from a cart with price update dynamically as items are moved in and out
- Buy now feature that directs you to your cart and checkout
- Checkout feature that allows users to pick shipping information and use online payment methods to purchase the products
- Checkout supports international shipping
- Success page that confirms when the item has been bought and if you would like to continue shopping still
